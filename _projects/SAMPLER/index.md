## Background

- Selected for NASA HUNCH Flight Hardware track, building flight-capable hardware for evaluation at Johnson Space Center
- Project focused on regolith handling and particle separation to support future lunar missions
- Designed to separate lunar simulant into consistent size fractions for testing and analysis
- Led a student engineering team from concept development through fabrication and testing

## Design

- Oscillating Cylinder Motion: Simulates centrifugal mixing, keeps particles moving across sieve surfaces
- Dual Concentric Sieves: Adjustable, allowing tuning for multiple particle sizes by changing aperture size (1â€“10 mm range)
- Tapered Throat: Holds material in while spinning
- Collection Bag Interface: Directs separated regolith into contained storage
- Rack-and-Pinion: Robust mechanical linkage to spin tool head, operable with gloved astronaut hands
- Adjustment Mechanism: Uses a threaded axle that changes sieve aperture size

## Impact

- Invited to present to engineers from Johnson Space Center in Houston, TX
- Plan to test 3D printed titanium prototype at the NASA SLOPE Lab
